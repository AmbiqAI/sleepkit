# SleepKit API

SleepKit is an AI Development Kit (ADK) that enables developers to easily build and deploy real-time __sleep-monitoring__ models on Ambiq's family of ultra-low power SoCs.
SleepKit explores a number of sleep related tasks including sleep staging, and sleep apnea detection.
The kit includes a variety of datasets, efficient model architectures, and a number of pre-trained models.
The objective of the models is to outperform conventional, hand-crafted algorithms with efficient AI models that still fit within the stringent resource constraints of embedded devices.
Furthermore, the included models are trainined using a large variety datasets- using a subset of biological signals that can be captured from a single body location such as head, chest, or wrist/hand.
The goal is to enable models that can be deployed in real-world commercial and consumer applications that are viable for long-term use.
