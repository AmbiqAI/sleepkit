SleepKit is an AI Development Kit (ADK) that enables developers to easily build and deploy real-time __sleep-monitoring__ models on Ambiq's family of ultra-low power SoCs. SleepKit explores a number of sleep related tasks including sleep staging, and sleep apnea detection. The kit includes a variety of datasets, efficient model architectures, and a number of pre-trained models. The objective of the models is to outperform conventional, hand-crafted algorithms with efficient AI models that still fit within the stringent resource constraints of embedded devices. Furthermore, the included models are trainined using a large variety datasets- using a subset of biological signals that can be captured from a single body location such as head, chest, or wrist/hand. The goal is to enable models that can be deployed in real-world commercial and consumer applications that are viable for long-term use.


**Key Features:**

* **Real-time**: Inference is performed in real-time on battery-powered, edge devices.
* **Efficient**: Leverage modern AI techniques coupled with Ambiq's ultra-low power SoCs
* **Extensible**: Easily add new tasks, models, and datasets to the framework.
* **Accurate**: Achieve SoTA results with stringent resource constraints

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Requirements</span>

* [Python ^3.11](https://www.python.org)
* [Poetry ^1.6.1](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

The following are also required to compile/flash the binary for the EVB demo:

* [Arm GNU Toolchain ^12.2](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
* [Segger J-Link ^7.92](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)

!!! note
    A [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is also available and defined in [./.devcontainer](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/sleepkit/tree/main/.devcontainer).

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Installation</span>

To get started, first install the local python package `sleepkit` along with its dependencies via `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Usage</span>

__SleepKit__ can be used as either a CLI-based app or as a python package to perform advanced experimentation. In both forms, SleepKit exposes a number of modes and tasks discussed below. Refer to the [Overview Guide](https://ambiqai.github.io/sleepkit/quickstart) to learn more about available options and configurations.

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Modes</span>

__SleepKit__ provides a number of **modes** that can be invoked for a given task. These modes can be accessed via the CLI or directly from the `task` within the Python package.

- **Download**: Download specified datasets
- **Feature**: Extract features from dataset(s)
- **Train**: Train a model for specified task and datasets
- **Evaluate**: Evaluate a model for specified task and datasets
- **Export**: Export a trained model to TF Lite and TFLM
- **Demo**: Run task-level demo on PC or EVB

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Tasks</span>

__SleepKit__ includes a number of built-in **tasks**. Each task provides reference routines for training, evaluating, and exporting the model. The routines can be customized by providing a configuration file or by setting the parameters directly in the code. Additional tasks can be easily added to the __SleepKit__ framework by creating a new task class and registering it to the __task factory__.

- **Detect**: Detect sustained sleep/inactivity bouts
- **Stage**: Perform advanced 2, 3, 4, or 5 stage sleep assessment
- **Apnea**: Detect hypopnea/apnea events

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Model Factory</span>

__SleepKit__ provides a __model factory__ that allows you to easily create and train customized models. The model factory includes a number of modern networks well suited for efficient, real-time edge applications. Each model architecture exposes a number of high-level parameters that can be used to customize the network for a given application. These parameters can be set as part of the configuration accessible via the CLI and Python package.

---


## <span class="sk-h2-span">Dataset Factory</span>

__SleepKit__ exposes several open-source datasets for training each of the SleepKit tasks via a __dataset factory__. For certain tasks, we also provide synthetic data provided by [PhysioKit](https://ambiqai.github.io/physiokit) to help improve model generalization. Each dataset has a corresponding Python class to aid in downloading and generating data for the given task. Additional datasets can be easily added to the SleepKit framework by creating a new dataset class and registering it to the dataset factory.

- **MESA**: A large-scale polysomnography dataset with 6,814 subjects collected from 6 field centers.

- **CMIDSS**: A dataset of 300 subjects with over 500 multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data annotated with two event types: onset, the beginning of sleep, and wakeup, the end of sleep.

- **YSYW**: A dataset of 1,983 polysomnography recordings provided by the Massachusetts General Hospitalâ€™s (MGH) Sleep Lab.

- **STAGES**: A dataset from the Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Model Zoo</span>

A number of pre-trained models are available for each task. These models are trained on a variety of datasets and are optimized for deployment on Ambiq's ultra-low power SoCs. In addition to providing links to download the models, __SleepKit__ provides the corresponding configuration files and performance metrics. The configuration files allow you to easily retrain the models or use them as a starting point for a custom model. Furthermore, the performance metrics provide insights into the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. For a number of the models, we provide experimental and ablation studies to showcase the impact of various design choices. Check out the [Model Zoo](https://ambiqai.github.io/sleepkit/zoo) to learn more about the available models and their corresponding performance metrics.
