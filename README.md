## Requirements

* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org)
* [Poetry 1.2.1+](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

The following are also required to compile/flash the binary for the EVB demo:

* [Arm GNU Toolchain 11.3](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
* [Segger J-Link v7.56+](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)

> NOTE: A [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is also available and defined in `./.devcontainer`.


## Installation

To get started, first install the local python package `sleepkit` along with its dependencies via `Poetry`:

```bash
poetry install
```

## Usage

__SleepKit__ is intended to be used as either a CLI-based app or as a python package to perform additional tasks and experiments.

## Experiments

Group sensors based on location.

Location: Head
Device: Earable, glasses, headband
Sensors: EEG, EOG, EMG, ACC/GYRO, PPG (ear)
Features: Raw, freq band power, movement
Networks: 1D/2D CNN+UNET, 1D/2D CNN+LSTM/GRU
Tasks: Sleep detect, Apnea, Sleep stage
Notes:
    * Using EEG and EOG data compute features that will be fed into AI model.
    * EEG/EOG is gold standard for determining sleep stage.
    * Minimal temporal context is needed (i.e. 5-10 seconds).
    * Most invasive

Location: Chest
Device: Chest strap/patch
Sensors: ECG, RIP, ACC/GYRO, TEMP
Features: HR, HRV, BPM, BRV, movement, body temp changes
Networks: 1D CNN+LSTM/GRU, 1D CNN+UNET
Notes:
    * Much longer context as more subject/night specific and looking for subtle changes.
    * Best location for tracking breathing

Location: Wrist/Ankle
Device: Watch, ring, strap
Sensors: PPG/SPO2, ACC/GYRO, TEMP
Features: HR, HRV, BPM?, movement, body temp changes
Networks: 1D CNN+LSTM/GRU, 1D CNN+UNET
Notes:
    * Much longer context as more subject/night specific and looking for subtle changes.
    * Least invasive
