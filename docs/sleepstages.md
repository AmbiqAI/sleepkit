# Sleep Stages

GAMMA: 30 - 80 HZ
BETA:  13 - 30 Hz
ALPHA:  8 - 13 Hz
THETA:  4 - 8 Hz
DELTA:  1 - 4 Hz

K_COMPLEX: Brief neg high voltage peak (> 100 uV) followed by slower positive complexes followed by slow-wave (0.8 Hz) and DELTA (1.6 - 4.0 Hz) oscillations
SLEEP_SPINDLE: 11 - 16 Hz

Applied to 30 second epochs

Wake (W0)

* Primarily ALPHA (8 - 13 Hz), eye blink (0.5 - 2 Hz), reading eye movement
* More than 50\% of epoch has alpha rhythm over occipital region, no K complexes, no spindles


Stage 1 (N1)

* ALPHA attenuates, activity in THETA (4-7 Hz), slow eye movement (no blink), no K complexes, no spindles
* Activity in THETA (4-7 Hz) with slowing of background frequencies
* Slow eye movement


Stage 2 (N2)

* One or more K complexes (no arousals) / sleep spindles from onset of epoch
* Continued low amplitude, mixed freq following above
* Sleep spindle 11 - 16 Hz, 0.5 - 1.5 seconds
* K Complex: Brief neg high voltage peak (> 100 uV) followed by slower positive complexes
* Slow-wave (0.8 Hz) and delta (1.6-4.0 Hz) oscillations


Stage 3/4 (N3)

* 5-6 DELTA waves ( < 2 Hz, 75 uV, 0.5 - 2 sec), no eye movement
* May / may not have sleep spindles / k complexes (no arousals)


REM (REM5)

* EEG similar to N1 (may see sawtooth waves appearing as notched waves in theta range)
* EOG shows burst of rapid eye movement (density increases with sleep )
