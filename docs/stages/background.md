# Background

## Stages

### Wake (W)

This is the time before or after bed when individual is awake.

Key Characteristics

* Alpha waves on the EEG
* No K-complexes or sleep spindles
* Eye movements are normal
* Respiratory rate and heart rate are normal
* Body movements are common

### Light Sleep (N1)

This is the shortest and lightest stage of sleep. It is the transition from wakefulness to sleep. It is characterized by slow eye movements, and alpha and theta waves on the EEG. It is also known as somnolence, or drowsy sleep. This stage lasts around 1 to 5 minutes, consisting of 5% of total sleep time. This stage is extremely difficult by EEG alone, and is often misclassified as wake or N2.

Key Characteristics:

* Alpha and theta waves on the EEG
* No K-complexes or sleep spindles
* Slow eye movements
* Respiratory rate and heart rate are normal
* Body temperature begins to drop
* Muscles relax; might jerk


### Deeper Sleep (N2)

This stage represents deeper sleep as the body begins to prepare for deep sleep. Physiologically, the body temperature begins to drop and the heart rate begins to slow. The stage is characterized by sleep spindles and K-complexes on the EEG. Stage 2 sleep lasts around 10 to 25 minutes, consisting of 45% to 55% of total sleep time. The duration increases as the night progresses.

Key Characteristics:

* Sleep spindles and K-complexes on the EEG
* No eye movements
* Respiratory rate and heart rate slows
* Body temperature drops
* Body movements are rare

### Deepest Sleep (N3)

Stage 3 sleep is the deepest stage of sleep. It is characterized by delta waves on the EEG. It is also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS) or delta sleep. It is difficult to wake someone from this stage. Stage 3 sleep lasts around 20 to 40 minutes, consisting of 3% to 8% of total sleep time. The duration decreases as the night progresses.

Key Characteristics:

* Delta waves on the EEG
* No eye movements
* Blood pressure drops, flow increases
* Respiratory rate and heart rate are at lowest levels
* Body movements are rare (sleep walking, sleep talking, bed wetting, and night terrors may occur)

### REM Sleep (REM)

The REM stage is characterized by rapid eye movements, low muscle tone, and dreaming. It is also known as paradoxical sleep. It is difficult to wake someone from this stage. REM sleep lasts around 10 to 60 minutes, consisting of 20% to 25% of total sleep time. The duration increases as the night progresses.

* Brain activity mimicks normal awake
* Rapid eye movements
* Respiration increases and irregular
* Heart rate increases
* Temperature regulation is off
* Body becomes immobile




GAMMA: 30 - 80 HZ
BETA:  13 - 30 Hz
ALPHA:  8 - 13 Hz
THETA:  4 - 8 Hz
DELTA:  1 - 4 Hz

K_COMPLEX: Brief neg high voltage peak (> 100 uV) followed by slower positive complexes followed by slow-wave (0.8 Hz) and DELTA (1.6 - 4.0 Hz) oscillations
SLEEP_SPINDLE: 11 - 16 Hz

Applied to 30 second epochs

Wake (W0)

* Primarily ALPHA (8 - 13 Hz), eye blink (0.5 - 2 Hz), reading eye movement
* More than 50\% of epoch has alpha rhythm over occipital region, no K complexes, no spindles


Stage 1 (N1)

* ALPHA attenuates, activity in THETA (4-7 Hz), slow eye movement (no blink), no K complexes, no spindles
* Activity in THETA (4-7 Hz) with slowing of background frequencies
* Slow eye movement


Stage 2 (N2)

* One or more K complexes (no arousals) / sleep spindles from onset of epoch
* Continued low amplitude, mixed freq following above
* Sleep spindle 11 - 16 Hz, 0.5 - 1.5 seconds
* K Complex: Brief neg high voltage peak (> 100 uV) followed by slower positive complexes
* Slow-wave (0.8 Hz) and delta (1.6-4.0 Hz) oscillations


Stage 3/4 (N3)

* 5-6 DELTA waves ( < 2 Hz, 75 uV, 0.5 - 2 sec), no eye movement
* May / may not have sleep spindles / k complexes (no arousals)


REM (REM5)

* EEG similar to N1 (may see sawtooth waves appearing as notched waves in theta range)
* EOG shows burst of rapid eye movement (density increases with sleep )
