# Guides

These guides cover a wide range of SleepKit topics, from core concepts to experiments to complete notebook training examples. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the SleepKit ADK framework and its capabilities.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Core Concepts</span>

This section contains guides to explain the core concepts of SleepKit.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Experiments</span>

This section contains experiments to investigate the impact of different design choices on the performance of the model.

- **[Sleep Stage Ablation](./stage-ablation.md)**: Ablation studies to investigate the impact of different design choices on the performance of 4-stage sleep staging.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Notebook Examples</span>

This section contains Jupyter notebook examples to demonstrate the training process of SleepKit.

- **[Train Sleep Detection Model](./train-detect-model.md)**: Train a wrist-based sleep detection model using only accelerometer data.
