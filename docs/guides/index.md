# Guides

These guides cover a wide range of sleepKIT topics, from core concepts to experiments to complete notebook training examples. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sleepKIT ADK framework and its capabilities.

## Core Concepts

This section contains guides to explain the core concepts of sleepKIT.

## Experiments

This section contains experiments to investigate the impact of different design choices on the performance of the model.

- **[Sleep Stage Ablation](./stage-ablation.md)**: Ablation studies to investigate the impact of different design choices on the performance of 4-stage sleep staging.

## Notebook Examples

This section contains Jupyter notebook examples to demonstrate the training process of sleepKIT.

- **[Train Sleep Detect Model](train-detect-model.ipynb)**: Training simple sleep detection model using IMU data on wrist.
