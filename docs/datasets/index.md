SleepKit provides support for a number of datasets to facilitate training the __sleep-monitoring tasks__. Most of the datasets are readily available and can be downloaded and used for training and evaluation. Please make sure to review each dataset's license for terms and limitations.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Sleep Detect</span>

Sleep detection is identifying periods of sleep and wakefulness from physiological signals. The following datasets are available for sleep detection tasks:

* **[MESA](./mesa.md)**: A longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6,814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese

* **[CMIDSS](./cmidss.md)**: The Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States (CMIDSS) dataset comprises 300 subjects with over 500 multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data annotated with two event types: onset, the beginning of sleep, and wakeup, the end of sleep.

* **[YSYW](./ysyw.md)**: A total of 1,983 PSG recordings were provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital’s (MGH) Sleep Lab in the Sleep Division together with the Computational Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory, and the Clinical Data Ani- mation Center.

* **[STAGES](./stages.md)**: The Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study is a prospective cross-sectional, multi-site study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers including Stanford University, Bogan Sleep Consulting, Geisinger Health, Mayo Clinic, MedSleep, and St. Luke's Hospital.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Sleep Stage Assessment</span>

Sleep stage assessment is the process of identifying the sleep stage of an individual. The following datasets are available for sleep stage assessment tasks:

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Sleep Apnea</span>

Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing or periods of shallow breathing during sleep. The following datasets are available for sleep apnea tasks:

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Sleep Arousal</span>

Sleep arousal is the process of waking up from sleep. The following datasets are available for sleep arousal tasks:

* **[MESA](./mesa.md)**: A longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6,814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese
