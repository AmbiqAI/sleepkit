SleepKit is a collection of optimized open-source TinyML models purpose-built to enable running a variety of real-time sleep-monitoring applications on battery-powered, edge devices. The objective is to outperform conventional, hand-crafted algorithms with efficient AI models that fit within stringent resource constraints of embedded devices. SleepKit leverages Ambiq's [PhysioKit](https://ambiqai.github.io/physiokit) to extract a variety of rich physiological features from raw sensory data.

**Key Features:**

* Efficient: Leverage modern AI techniques coupled with Ambiq's ultra-low power SoCs
* Generalizable: Multi-modal, multi-task, multi-dataset
* Accurate: Achieve SoTA with minimal resources

## Requirements

* [Python 3.11+](https://www.python.org)
* [Poetry 1.2.1+](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

The following are also required to compile/flash the binary for the EVB demo:

* [Arm GNU Toolchain 11.3](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
* [Segger J-Link v7.56+](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)

!!! note
    A [VSCode Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is also available and defined in [./.devcontainer](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/sleepkit/tree/main/.devcontainer).

## Installation

To get started, first install the local python package `sleepkit` along with its dependencies via `Poetry`:

<div class="termy">

```console
$ poetry install

---> 100%
```

</div>

<!-- ```bash
poetry install
``` -->

## Usage

__SleepKit__ can be used as either a CLI-based app or as a python package to perform advanced experimentation. In both forms, SleepKit exposes a number of modes and tasks discussed below. Refer to the [Overview Guide](./overview.md) to learn more about available options and configurations.

## Modes

* `download`: Download datasets
* `feature`: Extract features from dataset(s)
* `train`: Train a model for specified task and datasets
* `evaluate`: Evaluate a model for specified task and datasets
* `export`: Export a trained model to TensorFlow Lite and TFLM
* `demo`: Run demo on PC or EVB

## Tasks

* `stage`: Perform 2, 3, 4, or 5 stage sleep detection
<!-- * `apnea`: Detect hypopnea/apnea events
* `arousal`: Detect sleep arousal events -->

## Architecture

SleepKit leverages modern architectural design strategies to achieve high accuracy while maintaining a small memory footprint and low power consumption. Refer to specific task guides for additional details on the full model design.

* Seperable (depthwise + pointwise) Convolutions
* Inverted Residual Bottleneck
* Squeeze & Excitation Blocks
* Over-Parameterized Convolutional Branches
* Dilated Convolutions

## Datasets

SleepKit uses several open-source datasets for training each of the task's models. In general, we use commercial use friendly datasets that are publicly available. Check out the [Datasets Guide](./datasets.md) to learn more about the datasets used along with their corresponding licenses and limitations.

## Results

The following table provides the latest performance and accuracy results of all models when running on Apollo4 Plus EVB. Additional result details can be found in [Results Section](./results.md).
