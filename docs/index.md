SleepKit is an AI Development Kit (ADK) that enables developers to easily build and deploy real-time __sleep-monitoring__ models on Ambiq's family of ultra-low power SoCs. SleepKit explores a number of sleep related tasks including sleep detection, staging, and sleep apnea detection. The kit includes a variety of datasets, feature sets, efficient model architectures, and a number of pre-trained models. The objective of the models is to outperform conventional, hand-crafted algorithms with efficient AI models that still fit within the stringent resource constraints of embedded devices. Furthermore, the included models are trainined using a large variety datasets- using a subset of biological signals that can be captured from a single body location such as head, chest, or wrist/hand. The goal is to enable models that can be deployed in real-world commercial and consumer applications that are viable for long-term use.

**Key Features:**

* **Real-time**: Inference is performed in real-time on battery-powered, edge devices.
* **Efficient**: Leverage modern AI techniques coupled with Ambiq's ultra-low power SoCs
* **Generalizable**: Multi-modal, multi-task, multi-dataset
* **Open Source**: SleepKit is open source and available on GitHub.

Please explore the SleepKit Docs, a comprehensive resource designed to help you understand and utilize all the built-in features and capabilities.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Usage</span>

__SleepKit__ can be used as either a CLI-based tool or as a Python package to perform advanced development. In both forms, SleepKit exposes a number of modes and tasks outlined below. In addition, by leveraging highly-customizable configurations, SleepKit can be used to create custom workflows for a given application with minimal coding. Refer to the [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) to quickly get up and running in minutes.

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Tasks</span>

__SleepKit__ includes a number of built-in [tasks](./tasks/index.md). Each task provides reference routines for training, evaluating, and exporting the model. The routines can be customized by providing a configuration file or by setting the parameters directly in the code. Additional tasks can be easily added to the __SleepKit__ framework by creating a new task class and registering it to the __task factory__.

- **[Detect](./tasks/detect.md)**: Detect sustained sleep/inactivity bouts
- **[Stage](./tasks/stage.md)**: Perform advanced sleep stage assessment
- **[Apnea](./tasks/apnea.md)**: Detect hypopnea/apnea events
- **[BYOT](./tasks/byot.md)**: Bring-Your-Own-Task (BYOT) to create custom tasks

---

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Modes</span>

The __ADK__ provides a number of [modes](./modes/index.md) that can be invoked for a given task. These modes can be accessed via the CLI or directly within the Python package. Each mode is accompanied by a set of [task parameters](./modes/configuration.md) that can be customized to fit the user's needs.

- **[Download](./modes/download.md)**: Download specified datasets
- **[Feature](./features/index.md)**: Generate features from datasets
- **[Train](./modes/train.md)**: Train a model for specified task and feature set
- **[Evaluate](./modes/evaluate.md)**: Evaluate a model for specified task and feature set
- **[Export](./modes/export.md)**: Export a trained model to TensorFlow Lite and TFLM
- **[Demo](./modes/demo.md)**: Run task-level demo on PC or remotely on Ambiq EVB

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Datasets</span>

__SleepKit__ includes several open-source datasets via the __dataset factory__. Each dataset has a corresponding Python class to aid in downloading and extracting the data. The datasets are used to generate feature sets that are then used to train and evaluate the models. Check out the [Datasets Guide](./datasets/index.md) to learn more about the available datasets along with their corresponding licenses and limitations.

* **[MESA](./datasets/mesa.md)**: A longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6,814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese
* **[CMIDSS](./datasets/cmidss.md)**: The Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States (CMIDSS) dataset comprises 300 subjects with over 500 multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data annotated with two event types: onset, the beginning of sleep, and wakeup, the end of sleep.
* **[YSYW](./datasets/ysyw.md)**: A total of 1,983 PSG recordings were provided by the Massachusetts General Hospitalâ€™s (MGH) Sleep Lab in the Sleep Division together with the Computational Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory, and the Clinical Data Ani- mation Center.
* **[STAGES](./datasets/stages.md)**: The Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study is a prospective cross-sectional, multi-site study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers including Stanford University, Bogan Sleep Consulting, Geisinger Health, Mayo Clinic, MedSleep, and St. Luke's Hospital.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">Models</span>

The __ADK__ provides a variety of model architectures geared towards efficient, real-time edge applications. These models are provided by Ambiq's [neuralspot-edge](https://ambiqai.github.io/neuralspot-edge/) and expose a set of parameters that can be used to fully customize the network for a given application. In addition, SleepKit includes a model factory, [ModelFactory](./models/index.md#model-factory), to register current models as well as allow new custom architectures to be added. Check out the [Models Guide](./models/index.md) to learn more about the available network architectures and model factory.
