### Overview

Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an NHLBI-sponsored 6-center collaborative longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6,814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese-American men and women initially ages 45-84 at baseline in 2000-2002. There have been four follow-up exams to date, in the years 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2007, and 2010-2011. Between 2010-2012, 2,237 participants also were enrolled in a Sleep Exam (MESA Sleep) which included full overnight unattended polysomnography, 7-day wrist-worn actigraphy, and a sleep questionnaire. The objectives of the sleep study are to understand how variations in sleep and sleep disorders vary across gender and ethnic groups and relate to measures of subclinical atherosclerosis.

## STAGES Dataset

## Overview

The Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study is a prospective cross-sectional, multi-site study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers including Stanford University, Bogan Sleep Consulting, Geisinger Health, Mayo Clinic, MedSleep, and St. Luke's Hospital. The project has collected data on 1,500 adult/adolescent patients evaluated for sleep disorders, including:

* Objective nocturnal sleep polysomnography (PSG) recordings (EEGs, chin and leg EMGs, nasal and oral breathing, chest movements, leg movements, position, EKG). This is the gold standard for sleep evaluation in sleep clinics.
* Comprehensive subjective sleep symptoms assessment through an on-line sleep questionnaire called the Alliance Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ, developed over 5 years by 5 academic institutions). The questionnaire also includes key medical history questions.
* Continuous actigraphy over several weeks to get untransformed activity counts (a Huami/Xiaomi actigraph device has been identified and validated against PSG and clinical gold standard Actiwatch)
* 3-D facial scans to extract craniofacial features predictive of sleep apnea (not available on NSRR)
* On-line neuropsychological assessments and psychovigilance tests (impact of sleep disorders)
* Medical record data (not available on NSRR)

All data, samples, analytic tools, and supporting documentation will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher, provided a request is submitted to the National Sleep Research Resource and approved.

The National Sleep Research Resource is grateful to the STAGES team for sharing these data.
