### Overview

Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is an NHLBI-sponsored 6-center collaborative longitudinal investigation of factors associated with the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease and the progression of subclinical to clinical cardiovascular disease in 6,814 black, white, Hispanic, and Chinese-American men and women initially ages 45-84 at baseline in 2000-2002. There have been four follow-up exams to date, in the years 2003-2004, 2004-2005, 2005-2007, and 2010-2011. Between 2010-2012, 2,237 participants also were enrolled in a Sleep Exam (MESA Sleep) which included full overnight unattended polysomnography, 7-day wrist-worn actigraphy, and a sleep questionnaire. The objectives of the sleep study are to understand how variations in sleep and sleep disorders vary across gender and ethnic groups and relate to measures of subclinical atherosclerosis.

### Funding

The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Sleep Ancillary study was funded by NIH-NHLBI Association of Sleep Disorders with Cardiovascular Health Across Ethnic Groups (RO1 HL098433). MESA is supported by NHLBI funded contracts HHSN268201500003I, N01-HC-95159, N01-HC-95160, N01-HC-95161, N01-HC-95162, N01-HC-95163, N01-HC-95164, N01-HC-95165, N01-HC-95166, N01-HC-95167, N01-HC-95168 and N01-HC-95169 from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and by cooperative agreements UL1-TR-000040, UL1-TR-001079, and UL1-TR-001420 funded by NCATS. The National Sleep Research Resource was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (R24 HL114473, 75N92019R002).

## <span class="sk-h2-span">STAGES Dataset</span>

### Overview

The Stanford Technology Analytics and Genomics in Sleep (STAGES) study is a prospective cross-sectional, multi-site study involving 20 data collection sites from six centers including Stanford University, Bogan Sleep Consulting, Geisinger Health, Mayo Clinic, MedSleep, and St. Luke's Hospital. The project has collected data on 1,500 adult/adolescent patients evaluated for sleep disorders, including:

* Objective nocturnal sleep polysomnography (PSG) recordings (EEGs, chin and leg EMGs, nasal and oral breathing, chest movements, leg movements, position, EKG). This is the gold standard for sleep evaluation in sleep clinics.
* Comprehensive subjective sleep symptoms assessment through an on-line sleep questionnaire called the Alliance Sleep Questionnaire (ASQ, developed over 5 years by 5 academic institutions). The questionnaire also includes key medical history questions.
* Continuous actigraphy over several weeks to get untransformed activity counts (a Huami/Xiaomi actigraph device has been identified and validated against PSG and clinical gold standard Actiwatch)
* 3-D facial scans to extract craniofacial features predictive of sleep apnea (not available on NSRR)
* On-line neuropsychological assessments and psychovigilance tests (impact of sleep disorders)
* Medical record data (not available on NSRR)

All data, samples, analytic tools, and supporting documentation will be made publicly available for use by any interested researcher, provided a request is submitted to the National Sleep Research Resource and approved.

The National Sleep Research Resource is grateful to the STAGES team for sharing these data.

### Overview

A total of 1,983 PSG recordings were provided by the Massachusetts General Hospitalâ€™s (MGH) Sleep Lab in the Sleep Division together with the Computational Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory, and the Clinical Data Ani- mation Center. The Partners Institutional Review Board approved retrospective analysis of the MGH dataset with- out requiring additional consent.

## <span class="sk-h2-span">CMIDSS Dataset</span>

### Overview

This dataset comes from the Child Mind Institute - Detect Sleep States (CMIDSS) Kaggle competition. The dataset comprises 300 subjects with over 500 multi-day recordings of wrist-worn accelerometer data annotated with two event types: onset, the beginning of sleep, and wakeup, the end of sleep. While the original data contains 3-axis accelerometer data, this dataset only contains the euclidean norm minus one (ENMO) and z-angle reported every 5 seconds.

More info available on [PhysioNet website](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2018/1.0.0)

### Funding

The data was provided by the Healthy Brain Network, a landmark mental health study based in New York City that will help children around the world. In the Healthy Brain Network, families, community leaders, and supporters are partnering with the Child Mind Institute to unlock the secrets of the developing brain. In addition to generous support provided by the Kaggle team, financial support has been provided by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF) as part of its Global Health Initiative (GHI) through the SNF Global Center for Child and Adolescent Mental Health at the Child Mind Institute.
